Just trying to learn some CSS stuff.

Which seems to be quite important.

### ❕ This repo is an archive that contains my work about CSS grid, nothing more ❕

If you really want to see what I've done, just go [here](https://github.com/Santeenee/learning-CSS-grid/search?q=lesson&type=commits&o=asc)

    and YES, the first lesson is the 2nd

\(I'm following [TheNetNinja playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9itC4TxYMzFCfveyutyPOCY) that teaches CSS grid\)
